# canvastoedx
A set of tools to migrate UC Berkeley Canvas courses to edX with ease. 

edx-upload.py - Completely uploads all of a course based on a csv format (in this case it is video list.csv)

loginkeys.py - make sure to enter the course urls and your logins for these courses - also make sure to add your column names for the csv in there

codiolink.py - pulls the codio link for each Canvas lesson but can be modified to pull whatever else element or information you want
